What can look good for one person can be clown makeup on another.  How can you change that?  That is what FaceFocus is for.  
The goal is to work with brands such as Sephora and Mac with their most popular color palettes to try on for a wedding or to change your current makeup style.  After trying a few color matches, then be able to purchase immediately from your mobile phone.  
How FaceFocus works is to take a picture against a solid white background (as in printer paper). Then our application will analyze the photo to find your skin color, eye color, and face shape to find you the perfect look for your event. You can also pick out individual products such as a lipstick and try it on.   
Our main source of revenue would come from advertising who want showcase their most popular items in addition to work in conjunction with high end events such as Fashion Week to showcase their spring lines.
